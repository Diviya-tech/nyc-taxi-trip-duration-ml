**Observations:**

- Model 3 achieved the lowest validation loss, indicating better generalization.
- Training and validation curves remain close, suggesting limited overfitting.
- Model 1 converged slowly and plateaued at a higher MSE.
- Model complexity and activation choices significantly impacted convergence behavior.
